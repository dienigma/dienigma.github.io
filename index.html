        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I am Chinmay. I am a budding fullstack developer and currently love working in JavaScript and Python.</p>
        <p>I believe in being a good generalist rather than being an average specialist. That makes me the last guy on this planet who would hesitate to pick up new skills and technologies</p>
        <p>I both use and believe in "Ubuntu". More importantly the word because it means I am because we are. I am always excited about building something with a <strong>team</strong> that would change the world for good.</p>
